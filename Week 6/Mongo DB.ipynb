    "MongoDB is a popular, open-source, NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents rather than in tables like relational databases. Itâ€™s designed for scalability and high performance, making it ideal for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",

    "Non-relational databases (also known as NoSQL databases) are databases that do not use the traditional tabular schema of rows and columns. They store data in formats like key-value pairs, documents, or graphs, and can handle different types of data without a fixed schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases When the data structure is flexible and does not fit easily into tables, When you need to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g., JSON-like data), When scalability and performance across distributed systems are important (e.g., web applications with a large and constantly changing dataset), In cases where the schema may evolve over time or the database should support rapid iteration, like with agile development."
