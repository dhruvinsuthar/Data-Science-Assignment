    "Multiprocessing in Python is a technique where a program uses multiple processes to perform tasks concurrently. Each process runs independently and has its own memory space, unlike threads that share the same memory space. This allows tasks to be processed in parallel, taking full advantage of multi-core processors. It is useful for CPU-bound tasks that require heavy computation, as it bypasses Pythonâ€™s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), enabling true parallel execution of processes."

    "A multiprocessing pool is a way to manage a collection of worker processes in Python. Instead of creating individual processes manually, a pool allows you to parallelize a task by distributing it across multiple worker processes. It is useful when you have a large number of tasks to be executed, as the pool efficiently manages a fixed number of worker processes, reducing overhead and improving performance."
