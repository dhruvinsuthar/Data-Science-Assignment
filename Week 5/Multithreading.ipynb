    "Multithreading has some clear advantages. It can improve performance by allowing multiple tasks to run at the same time, especially useful in I/O-bound tasks like reading files or handling multiple user requests. It also makes a program more responsive because it can perform background tasks without blocking the main flow.\n",

It can lead to issues like deadlocks and race conditions if threads aren’t properly managed. Additionally, Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can limit the effectiveness of multithreading in CPU-bound tasks, as it allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time."
