    "# Q1. What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?\n",
    "# A1. Ridge Regression is a linear regression technique that adds an L2 regularization penalty (the square of the coefficients) to the cost function. \n",
    "# This penalty helps to shrink the magnitude of coefficients, addressing multicollinearity and improving model generalization.\n",
    "# In contrast, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression minimizes only the residual sum of squares without any penalty term, which can lead to overfitting, especially in datasets with multicollinearity or high-dimensional features."
