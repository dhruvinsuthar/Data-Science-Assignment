    "# Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "# A1. Lasso Regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a linear regression technique that adds an L1 regularization penalty (the absolute value of the coefficients) to the cost function. \n",
    "# Unlike Ridge Regression, Lasso can shrink some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection. This makes it particularly useful in high-dimensional datasets."

    "# - Ridge shrinks coefficients but does not set them to zero, retaining all features.\n",
    "# - Lasso shrinks some coefficients to exactly zero, performing feature selection.\n",
    "# - Ridge is better suited for datasets where all predictors are relevant, while Lasso is preferred for sparse datasets with irrelevant features."
